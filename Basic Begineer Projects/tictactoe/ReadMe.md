This is the final code for the tictactoe game. It is functional and works
perfectly. The only problem I have with this is that when I open it with 
file, all the CSS are messed up, but with npm live-server it works perfectly.
So I'm going to create two version of it, one that works on live-server and 
the other one should contains animations for crossing out the Xs and Os and 
the css adjusted for files.
